 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build your
 own rtl8723bs-mp-driver-modules. The rtl8723bs-mp-driver-source package has
 been provided for use with the Debian's module-assistant or kernel-package
 utilities to produce a version of rtl8723bs-mp-driver-modules for your kernel.
