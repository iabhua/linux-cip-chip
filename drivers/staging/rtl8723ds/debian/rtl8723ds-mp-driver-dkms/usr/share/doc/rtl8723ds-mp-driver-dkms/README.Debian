Important note
==============

Driver from Realtek conflicts with the following modules:
 * rtl8723ds, Realtek driver being cleaned for upstream

These modules are blacklisted in the
/etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723ds-mp-driver-dkms.conf file, initrd file is
automatically rebuilt by dkms but you need to restart your computer at the
first installation.

Please note that any network card that requires b44 module will not work until
rtl8723ds-mp-driver-dkms is installed.

The plan is to create an upstream driver in the linux kernel.  When that works,
consider using one of the upstream drivers instead.
