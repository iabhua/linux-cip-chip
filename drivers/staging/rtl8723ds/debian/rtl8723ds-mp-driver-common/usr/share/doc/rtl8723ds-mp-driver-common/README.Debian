Important note
==============

This driver from conflicts with r8723ds module, so we have to blacklist
the following modules:
 * r8723ds, rtl8723ds driver being cleaned for upstreaming

This is done in /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723ds-mp-driver-common.conf file, you also
should rebuild initrd file with the following command:

        # update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`
